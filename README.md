# Financial Health Assessment Tool

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning-based tool to assess the financial health and creditworthiness of companies. The tool will analyze historical financial data, focusing on debt management and credit risk evaluation, to predict whether a company will be tagged as a defaulter in terms of net worth in the following year.

## Context
In modern finance, managing debt obligations is crucial for maintaining a favorable credit standing and fostering sustainable growth. Investors need tools to evaluate the financial stability of companies, and this project aims to empower them with a robust mechanism for doing so.

## Objective
The tool will facilitate:
- **Debt Management Analysis**: Identifying patterns and trends in debt management practices.
- **Credit Risk Evaluation**: Evaluating key financial indicators to assess credit risk exposure.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Financial metrics of different companies provided by venture capitalists.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing financial data for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features from raw financial metrics.
- Model Development: Implementing machine learning models to predict default risk.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional financial ratios and metrics.
- Explore more sophisticated models like ensemble methods or neural networks.
